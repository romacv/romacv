Since 2011 to the present, I have been developing iOS applications.
I can coordinate teamwork to develop high-quality projects, consult the clients and the team, or take the project as an independent work, using best practices in code writing.
Working with me, youâ€™ll get:
- responsible attitude;
- understanding and politeness in communication; 
- efficiency and compliance;

My hobbies: IT, computers, cars, motorcycles, finances, cryptocurrency, travel and exploration.
